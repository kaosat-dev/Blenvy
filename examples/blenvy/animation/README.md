# Animation example/demo

Example on how to control animations & how to use the provided helpers 
Two animated blueprints are provided: Bevy's Fox, and a Robot I created.

There is almost no boilerplate, other than setting up ```Bevy_gltf_blueprints```

If you want to jump straight to controlling the imported animations, jump to : 
[]('./src/game/in_game.rs#86')

## Running this example

```
cargo run --features bevy/dynamic_linking
```
